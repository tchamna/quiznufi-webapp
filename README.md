- Real-time updates without redeploying the app
- Timer for each question
- Score tracking
- Audio feedback for correct and incorrect answers
- Responsive design suitable for various devices

**Note** : Note: If you prefer not to set up a full Firebase project, you can use a simpler approach. Just uncomment the following line in your index.html:
`<script type="module" src="script_simple.js"></script>`

In this file, you can directly embed your questions and other quiz data without connecting to Firebase. This allows you to manage your quiz content locally without the need for a backend setup.
